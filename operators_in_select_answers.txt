/* Exercises */

1. Write out a generic SELECT statement.
A: SELECT value
   FROM table
   WHERE clause;

2. Create a fun way to remember the order of operations in a SELECT statement,
   such as a mnemonic.
A: I didn't create it, but while researching SQL I saw:
   Sweaty Feet Will Give Horrible Odors, corresponding to:
   SELECT FROM WHERE GROUP-BY HAVING ORDER-BY.

3. Given this dogs table, write queries to select the following pieces of data:
A: SELECT name, gender,  age
   FROM dogs
   WHERE breed LIKE '%labrador%';

   SELECT id
   FROM dogs
   WHERE age < 1;

   SELECT name, age
   FROM dogs
   WHERE gender='F' AND weight>35;

   SELECT *
   FROM dogs
   WHERE breed NOT LIKE '%shepherd%';

   SELECT id, age, weight, breed
   FROM dogs
   WHERE weight>60 OR breed='great dane';

4. Given this cats table, what records are returned from these queries?
A: Mushi, 2016-03-22
   Seashell,	null
   Azul,	2016-04-17
   Victoire,	2016-09-01
   Nala,	null

   Mushi, 1
   Seashell,	7
   Azul,	3
   Victoire,	7
   Nala,	1

5. From the cats table, write queries to select the following pieces of
   data.
A: SELECT *
   FROM cats;

   SELECT name, gender
   FROM cats
   WHERE age=7;

   SELECT name
   FROM cats;

6. List each comparison operator and explain when you would use it. Include
   a real world example for each.
A: < is used when you want to find all values less than a given value. Like finding
   all people who are less than 21 years old, not including 21 year olds.

   > is used when you want to find all values greater than a given value. i.e.
   finding all people who are over 21 years old, not including 21 year olds.

   <= similar to less than, but also includes the given value. You could use
   this to find people who are 20 years old and younger.

   >= similar to greater than, but includes the given value. Use it to find people
   who are 21 and older.

   != and <> are used to return values that are not equal to the given value. Find all students
   who did not get an F on their test. Not commonly used in queries since the speed is slower.

   = is used to return values that are the same as the given value. Find the students
   who received an A on their test.

7. From the cats table, what data is returned from these queries?
A: Seashell
   Nala
