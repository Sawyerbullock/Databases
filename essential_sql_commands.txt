/* Exercises */

1. List the commands for adding, updating, and deleting data.
A: INSERT INTO, UPDATE, DELETE FROM

2. Explain the structure for each type of command.
A: INSERT INTO - after the initial command, state the name of the table you
   wish to add to. Then, you have the option to either define the columns you
   wan to set the data to, or just type VALUES, followed by the corresponding
   values in the same order as the columns. If the values aren't in the same
   order as the corresponding columns, you may get an error.

   UPDATE - once again, this is followed by the name of the table you want to
   work with. Then you can use the SET and WHERE keywords, both of which can
   take multiple clauses. You can also change data by specifying multiple
   WHERE clauses using AND.

   DELETE FROM - again, specify the table you are deleting the data from. Then
   use WHERE to specify the data you want to remove. You can use the AND keyword
   to set multiple clauses for WHERE.

3. What are some of the data types that can be used in tables? Give a real-world
   example of each type.
A: Date - keeping track of birthdays
   Integer - display age
   Boolean - State whether or not someone is of legal drinking age

4. Decide how to create a new table to hold a list of people invited to a wedding
   dinner. The table needs to have first and last names, whether they sent in
   their RSVP, the number of guests they are bringing, and the number of meals
   (1 for adults and 1/2 for children).
A: CREATE TABLE wedding (
     first text,
     last text,
     rsvp boolean,
     guests integer,
     meals numeric(3, 1)
   );

   ALTER TABLE wedding ADD COLUMN thank-you boolean SET DEFAULT 'no';

   ALTER TABLE wedding DROP COLUMN meals;

   ALTER TABLE wedding ADD COLUMN table integer;

   DROP TABLE wedding;

5. Write a command to create a new table to hold the books in a library with the
   columns ISBN, title, author, genre, publishing date, number of copies, and
   available copies.
A: CREATE TABLE library (
     isbn bigint,
     title text,
     author text,
     genre text,
     published date,
     copies integer,
     available-copies integer,
   );

   INSERT INTO library VALUES (9780060935467, 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Harper Lee', 'Southern Gothic', '1960-07-11', 7, 7);
   INSERT INTO library VALUES (9780142407332, 'The Outsiders', 'S. E. Hinton', 'Young Adult Fiction', '1967-04-24', 5, 5);
   INSERT INTO library VALUES (9780743273565, 'The Great Gatsby', 'F. Scott Fitzgerald', 'Historical Fiction', '1925-04-10', 8, 8);

   UPDATE library SET available=6 WHERE title='To Kill a Mockingbird';

   DELETE FROM library WHERE title='The Outsiders';

6. Write a command to make a new table to hold spacecrafts. Information should
   include id, name, year launched, country of origin, a brief description of
   the mission, orbiting body, if it is currently operating, and its approximate
   miles from Earth. In addition to the table creation, provide commands that
   perform the following operations:
A: CREATE TABLE spacecraft (
     id integer,
     name text,
     year-launched integer,
     country text,
     mission text,
     orbiting text,
     in-operation boolean,
     miles-from-earth integer,
   );

   INSERT INTO spacecraft VALUES (1, 'Luna 10', 1966, 'Russia', 'Orbit the moon', 'Moon', 'no', 0);
   INSERT INTO spacecraft VALUES (2, 'Messenger', 2004, 'United States', 'The probe was launched to study Mercury's chemical composition, geology, and magnetic field.', 'Mercury', 'no', 0);
   INSERT INTO spacecraft VALUES (3, 'Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter', 2005, 'United States', 'Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) is a multipurpose spacecraft designed to conduct reconnaissance and exploration of Mars from orbit', 'Mars', 'yes', 33900000);

   DELETE FROM spacecraft WHERE id=2;

   UPDATE spacecraft SET in-operation='no' WHERE id=3;

7. Write a command to create a new table to hold the emails in your inbox. This
   table should include an id, the subject line, the sender, any additional
   recipients, the body of the email, the timestamp, whether or not you have
   read the email, and the id of the email chain it's in. Also provide commands
   that perform the following operations:
A: CREATE TABLE inbox (
     id integer,
     subject text,
     sender text,
     additional-recipients text,
     body text,
     timestamp timestamp,
     read boolean,
     email-chain text,
   );

   INSERT INTO inbox VALUES (1, 'Important', 'joe@email.com', 'sally@email.com', 'Let's have lunch.', '2018-12-13 13:23:14', 'yes', 'lunch');
   INSERT INTO inbox VALUES (2, 'Urgent', 'sally@email.com', 'joe@email.com', 'Sounds good to me!', '2018-12-13 13:31:25', 'no', 'lunch');
   INSERT INTO inbox VALUES (3, 'Meeting today', 'boss@work.com', 'none', 'Let's meet to discuss your deadlines.', '2018-12-10 08:43:02', 'yes', 'work');

   DELETE FROM inbox WHERE subject='Important';

   UPDATE inbox SET read="no" WHERE subject='Meeting today';
